# Alexander Kozhin's Tech Basic II Exam project

This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code.

I have built an MVP for Serenity â€“ Emotional Welness App. It has the following pages and features:

- When users run the `app.py` they are welcomed with **Homepage**, where the soothing music ðŸŽµ starts playing and they can find 'Login' and 'Register' buttons.

- If this is the user's first time on the app, then they will click on the new 'Register' button and go to the **Registration** page. The user data is stored in a .csv file. For this MVP I am sharing my test users data, but I will take care of data privacy before I launch my app.

  - Once the user is registered, they can log in to their **Activities** page, which greets them with their name and the current date.

- On the **Activities** page, users can log their anxiety level â€“ one of the key features of the app.

- Additionally, on the **Activities** page, users can access their past logs, accompanied by timestamps.

- One more feature of the app, users can certain activities to decrease their anxiety levels. On the **Meditation Practice** page ðŸŽµ, they can practice a singing bowls meditation, following the instruction on the screen and listening to the music.

- Lastly, users can do a breathing exercise to decrease their anxiety levels. On the **Breathing Exercise** pageðŸŽµ, they are also provided with instruction and music.
